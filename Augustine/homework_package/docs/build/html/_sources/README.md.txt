This is a coding assignment from some of the equations obtained from "Geometric phase effects in low-energy dynamics near conical intersections: A study of the multidimensional linear vibronic coupling model."

The code assumes a 10-dimensional hamiltonian as discussed from METHOD III,  A. Model Hamiltonian.

The LVC hamiltonian H which is a matrix is calculated from the sum of three parameters, Hs, HB and HsB. The values of these values are also obtained from some variables given in the paper and some assigned variables.

The final output of this programme is a text file that prints out the values of H, Hs, HB and HsB from 5 different iterations and also five plots from these iterations.
