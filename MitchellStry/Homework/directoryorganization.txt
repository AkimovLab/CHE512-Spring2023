The file structure is as follows

If the assignment is only a single document, it is within this highest level of the Homework directory.

If the assignment requires multiple files, it is within a directory within this Homework directory.
Directories within this directory have their name capitolized while files do not.

HW1 is from before the structure was created and does not follow these rules, but also doesn't contain anything.
